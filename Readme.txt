Following folder contains two files:

1.)index.php this file was used to combine all the SEC data which were divided on the basis of airline.WE can see the format of the sheets from the following link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1d7SiKdIO0H-Qv8VwGSqsrnE0TX6APJUA 

2.)index2.php this file was used to combine all the industry level data of the sheets present.Sheets must be in a specified format which is https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15LGHTm4EQ4hQigMxPADrc9HfpPQQIoEYoONubFrcNWE/edit?usp=sharing
